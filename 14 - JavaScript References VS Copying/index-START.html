        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log(players, team); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = 'Lux';
        console.log(players, team); //["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"] ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]
        // team is just a reference to the original array which is players- so when you edit that original array or when you update any of the arrays, it's going to go back to the reference where it was.

        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way
        const team2 = players.slice();
        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);
        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];

        const team5 = Array.from(players);
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80,
        };
        const per = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80,
        };
        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;
        captain.number = 99;
        console.log(person, captain); //Object {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99} Object {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99}

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
            age: 99
        });
        console.log(per, cap2); //bject {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80} Object {name: "Wes Bos", age: 99, number: 99}

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        // const cap3 = {...person};

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
        // assign method does only one level deep - to make a clone you have to find a function clone deep
